# USB-C PD Power Meter and Debug Tool

This project is a semi=professional-grade USB-C Power Delivery (PD) debug tool and power meter.  
Designed to practice modern embedded and hardware skills, it targets real-world USB PD analysis, control, and measurement.

**Main features:**
- USB-C PD sink with programmable voltage selection (5V/9V/12V/15V/20V)
- Output power and current measurement (INA219)
- IÂ²C OLED display and menu navigation via buttons
- Visual power contract status via indicator LEDs
- Modular, assembly-friendly, and manufacturable PCB design (KiCad 9)

**Current status:**  
- Schematic in-progress (see `00_Hardware`)
- Ongoing documentation (see `01_Docs`)
- Firmware and PCB layout to follow
